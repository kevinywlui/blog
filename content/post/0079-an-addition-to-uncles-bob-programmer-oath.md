I first learned about Uncle's Bob *Programmer's Oath* by watching [the video with the same name on cleancoders.com](https://cleancoders.com/episode/clean-code-episode-45/show).

I've since published my own version of this oath [on my website](https://dmerej.info/oath.md).

If you compare it with [the original](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/11/18/TheProgrammersOath.html), you will find one more item:

> In all my communications (especially in written form and in public), I will
> not allow myself to be offended by what I read, but I will
> do everything I can to not offend the people who'll read my messages.

Let me explain why I chose to add this.
